# VisualizationOfSearchAlgorithms

## Building
Pre-build versions are listed on the release page of this repository.

If you'd rather compile on your own, I suggest importing and building this repository using the eclipse-IDE. 

## Architecture
To create this software, I applied principles of the model-view-controller architectural pattern. 
In the early steps of the design phase, I created this class diagram to visualize the interaction between classes. It is not up to date with the current code but still conveys the idea behind my implementation.
